# SUR: Sanctuarizing Unaccompanied Refugees Data

**SUR** (Sanctuarizing Unaccompanied Refugees) is a proof-of-concept cryptographic infrastructure designed to protect the data of unaccompanied minors in humanitarian settings. It extends the Q2CSI framework to encode data relationally using three security layers: Iron, Gold, and Clay.

## Features
- Canonical context-aware hashing of child protection records
- Kinship vector hashing based on Ubuntu ethics
- Layered encoding model based on the CRO trilemma (Confidentiality, Reliability, Opposability)

## Structure
### data
- Chikdren Dataset (a JSON file)
### doc
- Mariam's Case: A case study examining the application of the SUR infrastructure through the journey of Mariam, a 10-year-old Mafa girl from Cameroon
- SUR Core Crypto: The complete cryptographic specification of the SUR infrastructureLayered encoding model based on the CRO trilemma (Confidentiality, Reliability, Opposability)
- The SUR Project: The overview of the SUR infrastructure, a Secure, Universal, and Responsible cryptographic framework rooted in African ethical paradigms
